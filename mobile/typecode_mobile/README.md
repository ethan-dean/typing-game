# This is the mobile app for TYPECODE

A new Flutter project.

Reed is using Flutter version 3.17.7

Open to using the most modern version but that would leave me a little inexperienced with it. 3.17.7 -> modern version, there are a ton of changes

main.dart is inside of the lib folder

Use VSCode with the flutter extension to develop for the mobile app (you could use android studio, but Leinecker advises against and I agree with him)

I learned a bit of Flutter from here, there is probably better resources to learn from, find your own
